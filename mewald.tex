\section{Personal Projects}

\cvitem{\href{https://meanstream.io}{MeanStream}}{
  As a Pre-Sales Engineer, I enhanced remote presentation experiences by
  utilizing Blackmagic Design HDMI switchers, leading to the development of an
  online service for managing switcher configurations. This platform allows
  users to design scenes and auto-generate macros for seamless transitions,
  including animations. Built with Spring, Angular, and MongoDB on Google Cloud
  Platform, the service is designed for scalability and reliability, and is
  currently available for free, showcasing my dedication to improving digital
  presentation tools and ability to develop software using modern frameworks
  and tools. \href{https://meanstream.io}{https://meanstream.io}\newline{}

\cvitem{\href{https://github.com/domotik8s/}{DomotiK8s}}{
  Leveraging my expertise in software development and my comprehensive knowledge
  of Kubernetes, I initiated and developed an innovative home automation system
  named DomotiK8s. This project, which I have made available on GitHub,
  represents a pioneering effort to extend the Kubernetes API to address and
  surpass the limitations found in existing smart home automation systems like
  Home Assistant and OpenHab. Through DomotiK8s, I have successfully combined
  cutting-edge technology with practical home automation needs, showcasing my
  ability to innovate and apply advanced technical skills to real-world
  problems. \href{https://github.com/domotik8s/}{https://github.com/domotik8s}
